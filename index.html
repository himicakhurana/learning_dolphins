  <h2>Discription</h2>
  <p>
     Spinner dolphins are known for their small cetaceans, which have a slender build, a triangular dorsal fin, and a dark gray dorsal area with light gray sides and a pale underside. Adult females are 4.6 to 6.7 feet long, and adult males are 5.2 to 6.8 feet long. They reach weights of at least 181 pounds. They have a slender, torpedo-shaped body with a long, thin beak (rostrum). </p>
<h2>Food</h2>
  <p>Spinner dolphins feed at night on small fish, shrimp, and squid found about 650 to 1,000 feet below the water's surface. Spinner dolphin prey species follow a vertical and horizontal migration pattern, staying in deep waters in the ocean during the day and then moving up in the water column (vertical migration) and inshore (horizontal migration) at night.</p>
